# ps2bootopia
Kernelloader-based PS2 Linux Bootloader  
Initial plans are for a refreshed GUI configurator for KernelLoader  
This could then chainload kernelloader.elf, check if elf supports args for cfg path  
Further plans are to integrate kernelloader's main functions into ps2bootopia UI, to deliver a unified experience with streamlined booting into Linux (or other *nixes? A build of BSD exists apparently...)
